<p><span class=rvts7>Memoranda is </span><span class=rvts8>open-source</span><span class=rvts7> software and is released under the </span><span class=rvts8>GNU general public license</span><span class=rvts7>.&nbsp; A copy of the license is included below:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>your programs, too.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>rights.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>distribute and/or modify the software.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>authors' reputations.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>modification follow.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p style="page-break-before: always;"><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>along with the Program.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p style="page-break-before: always;"><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>collective works based on the Program.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>the scope of this License.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>special exception, the source code distributed need not include</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>itself accompanies the executable.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p style="page-break-before: always;"><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>parties remain in full compliance.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>the Program or works based on it.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>this License.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>impose that choice.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>be a consequence of the rest of this License.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p style="page-break-before: always;"><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>address new problems or concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Foundation.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts7> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>when it starts in an interactive mode:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts7>necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:</span></p>
